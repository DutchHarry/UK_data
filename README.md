# UK_data

just some barely useful scripts to get UK metadata, and if you prefer to do so, download it to your HDs

For some strange reason UK guvmint agencies change their websites frequently, probably to shift some more monies to politically well connected IT businesses.
So you'll have to adapt scripts occasionally.

scripts you'll see here get (meta)data from:
data.gov.uk
ons.gov.uk
data.england.nhs.uk
digital.nhs.uk

I have some more, but that just stayed WIP to partly automate stuff, but feel free to ask if you want to safe yourself some time.
